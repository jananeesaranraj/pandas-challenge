You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

2.As per the scores by size of the schools(number of students)data,there is a significant difference of school's performance between schools that have less number of students and more number of students.The bigger size schools tend to have lower performance.

3.Overall Charter Schools out-performed in every criteria than the District Schools
